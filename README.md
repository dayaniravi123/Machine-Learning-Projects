## 1) Heart Failure prediction system
-> Here we have several observation from different hospitals and we need to find the risk of heart failure.
-> I have applied different machine learning algorithm on dataset
-> I have also cleanned all the dataset and encode categorical features
-> I have also built logistic model and random forest algorithm


## 2) Rain in Australia
Context
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

Content
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
