## 1) Heart Failure prediction system
-> Here we have several observation from different hospitals and we need to find the risk of heart failure.
-> I have applied different machine learning algorithm on dataset
-> I have also cleanned all the dataset and encode categorical features
-> I have also built logistic model and random forest algorithm


## 2) Rain in Australia
### Context
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

### Content
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more. 


## 3) Live Cell Problem
-> It's a segmantation problem. 
### Dataset:
-> Here, we have gray scale images of the neurons. There are around 610 images for training data and 3 images for the testing.
-> We have total 3 types of neurons.
